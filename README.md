# Hi — I'm Kush 👋

**Hardware × ML systems | Undergraduate @ Delhi Technological University**

I research hardware-aware ML optimizations: cycle-accurate simulators, verification RTL, and small accelerator prototypes.

## Featured projects
- **SpAtten** — Speculative lookahead token pruning simulator + verification Verilog. *69.39% mean speedup* demonstrated in the optimistic CV-demo sweep. ([Repo](https://github.com/KushKapoor2006/SpAtten))
- **island_gcn_simulator** — Simulator for islanded GCN execution and memory trade-offs. ([Repo](https://github.com/KushKapoor2006/island_gcn_simulator))
- **PIM_NN** — Proof-of-concept Processing-in-Memory neural primitives in SystemVerilog. ([Repo](https://github.com/KushKapoor2006/PIM_NN))

## Skills & interests
- Hardware design & RTL (Verilog / SystemVerilog)
- Accelerator architecture, memory systems, DRAM-aware modeling
- ML systems & simulation (Python, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Research, benchmarking, reproducible results
